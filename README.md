## Short description

Website that helps me with daily tasks. As of right now, it only syncs concerts with the following sites:

* TivoliVredenburg
* Paradiso
* Afas Live!
* Ziggo Dome
* Effenaar

Each night, this application retrieves the events that are happening in these venues and syncs them with the database. When there are new events, the support act for a event is changed, or a tracked event is changed, the application creates a feed item. The user can use the frontend to see feeditems. For each venue, he can set the a flag to mark it as tracked.
